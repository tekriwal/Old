% Dr. Wu's analysis of the sleep was analyzed as accurately as possible by
% eye and ruler, that data was compiled and imported as three arrays, saved
% as "Pat4_WorkspaceItems.mat".

% Interval Number - indicates where in the sequence of the data that window
% came from (is this extranenous? Can't we just use the row # from the
% other arrays to figure out this same information?)
% Length - how long the sequence is in units of 30 seconds. This
% measurement was chosen to match with Dr. Wu's analysis as closely as
% possible
% Sleep Stage - this contains the score that each interval was given by Dr.
% Wu, the numbers 1-3 correspond to stages 1-3 as well, with 4 = W
% and 5 = R

% Need to assign each 30 second piece to a designation - how do we handle
% segments where there is a switch from one to the other? We did estimate
% where these transitions happen so chopping them out doesn't really seem
% to matter

%% Power spectrum

% We want to compute the power spectrum for 30 second windows in line with
% Dr. Wu's EEG analysis, and then compare those power spectrums across time
% using a spectrogram or some other wavelet feature

% We then want to compare our LFP's spectral analysis to Dr. Wu's and see
% if there are certain ephys signatures that align well with the
% transitions he suggests. One way to plot this is to import the time
% stamps Dr. Wu's suggested transitions as events in a histogram and see
% what local changes are occurring a bit before/during/after transition on
% spectral density plots, heatmaps, etc

% Compare to our own suggested sleep stage switches (if we have any
% generated)

% following test code should be able to be altered to fit our data, should
% be able to generate 30 second windows we can cycle through - I think


%test = randn(10,10);
 
for ti = 1:size(test,2)
   
    plot(test(:,ti),'r')
   
    pause
    % the 'pause' function will pause Matlab until you press any key
    close all
end

% for each thirty second window we want to be able to compute the power
% spectrum density, and then compare specific frequencies of interest
% within every thirty second against all others in order to see when psd
% <</>> 4 SD


% generate a line graph displaying LFPs'0-3' along the one LFP's DTm counterpart


% Generate a line graph displaying LFPs'0:3' along with DTm counterparts,
% use colors that make it easy to differentiate pairs, include legend,
% include Pat4_LFPm and DTm_Pat4_LFPm with a thickened line.


% How do we search for drop offs or increases in the power spectrum around
% the time when patients transition between sleep periods? I could see how
% defining some parameter like >2SD from the 30 second period before it
% gets flagged, but also seems like there may be a better way.



%% Coherence

% It is necessary to find a way to detect low level environmental noise,
% large artifacts detected across multiple recording contact sites, and
% have some statistical measure that justifies the signal we are recording
% is indeed physiologic. To do this, we want to get the coherence for
% certain frequencies/waveforms:

% We want to take a number of samples that we can then compare against one
% another intra contact recording. If we are assuming stoichastic activity,
% we'd want the windows to be the length we think populations could be
% modulating in, say 100 ms.

% Within those windows, we'd want to transform the data into discrete
% waveforms/equations

% We'd want to compare each window against one another per
% frequency/waveforms by taking the correlation constant for each window
% against every other window

% Make comparison from LFP to LFP in the hopes of identifying either A)
% identical artifacts that can be excluded or B) unique but complementary
% electronic signatures that we can use to characterize network level
% oscillations




%% ALL Raw LFPs Analysis

% Plot as the untransformed data and include error bars, numerically
% Measure coherence for each grouping of LFP's and all LFP's

% See how the coherence compares between patients, make note of any
% outliers and possible patterns in response to 


%% Misc

% Measure spectral density for ratio of beta/gamma as well as looking at
% body contact EEGs for evidence of tremor. I suspect there may be times in
% certain patients during their sleep cycle where tremor is apparent, and I
% would not be surprised to find this time closely with a significant change in
% beta/gamma

% Should we look for things like sleep spindles in the EEG recordings
% ourselves to validate our findings - may not be in places we expect in PD
% patients

%% Devise algorithm 
% To pick up on ephys signatures that we may find occurring at known
% intervals relative to sleep cycle

% See if we use our algorithm on data from Dr. O'Niel's pediatric
% population to make feasible inferences into their sleep architecture if
% applicable

% Create code that would be capabale of communicating between DBS hardware
% and implanted computer/BCI to enable for turn on/off in response to
% algorithm (machine learning?)

%% Sending scripts/results to collaborators for input
