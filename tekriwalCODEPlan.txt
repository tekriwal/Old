Plot 10000 samples of single LFP

1. Why are we detrending?

2. Steps
2a. Separately for each LFP electrode
	a. Compute global mean, SD and threshold (mean + (SD * 7)) on absolute value of recording (Why)
	b. Segment recording into 30 second epochs (per Hypnogram)
	c. Examine each segment
		i.   Detrend - to remove aberrant oscillations
		ii.  Assess whether to keep or discard epoch based on amplitude criteria
			1.  Compute absolute value of epoch
			2.  Compute mean of epoch
			3.  Does mean of epoch exceed global threshold?
	d. You should now have a detrended epochs of segment with a boolean vector indicating whether or not to keep the epoch
	e. Covert .jpeg of hypnogram to an integer vector of the sleep cycle info
	f. Use the sleep cycle vector, boolean vector of 'good' epochs and epoch matrix to analyze cycle specific epochs
	g. What next?...
